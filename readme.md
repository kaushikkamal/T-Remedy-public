**T Remedy** is an android based application developed for tea growers. This application gives a platform where they can easily find out the solution of various diseases related to tea husbandry and their management. This application is being maintained by a community of Assam Agriculture University.

As technology is being advanced the people are adapting the changes accordingly. The advancement of technology also brought a new way of farming. The biggest challenge for tea growers nowadays, is to produce tea without pesticide residues. The climatic conditions of the tea growing regions of India are conducive for a large number of insects and pests and diseases that needed to be managed. This project deals with the ways of protecting crops from diseases.

This project entitled T Remedy is an implementation of the above description. Farmers have knowledge of an android phone, they can directly register in the application and asked any questions related to tea diseases and also be able to upload the images of the symptoms. The application is design in such a way that all the posts are easily accessible to the users. The application provides a simple user interface that is easily understandable by anyone. It will encourage tea growers to work with technology for better results.

Here we also designed a web-based management system for admin so that they can easily maintain the application through the web. For adding flexibility to the system we designed an Application Programming Interface (API) which sharing the common database as that of the admin panel. The application uses this API to connect to the database. So that whenever any data is updated by admin the changes are reflected to the app automatically.
